# Advent of code 2018

This repository contains my solutions to puzzles that can be found at https://adventofcode.com/2018


This year my aim is to keep the solutions as concise as possible (one-liners preferred). I'll also try to use mainly the JavaScript console on the input page to save the hassle of copy-pasting the input somewhere else.
