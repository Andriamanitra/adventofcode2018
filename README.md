# Advent of code 2018

This repository contains my solutions to puzzles that can be found at https://adventofcode.com/2018

Originally my goal was to write this year's solutions entirely such that they can
be pasted to web browser console while looking at the input page. Turns out I do
not really like writing JavaScript so I only did two days that way... The new (2022)
plan is to use all kinds of nice languages, probably mostly Ruby.
